## Implementing UART redirection using `socat`

- `socat` can redirect data from a serial port to several different format
- Basic configuration tested
	- `socat -d -d /dev/ttyXR6,b115200,raw UDP:127.0.0.1:5000`
		- This command redirects data from the incoming port to a UDP socket internally 
		- Need to have a separate process for each payload that will match the speed they are using
		- [x] write a script to handel all of there
		- [ ] make it a boot service

## Basic testing - 2 HS sim payloads + 2 LS payload

- No data losses were noted 
- More testing is needed to verify, but basic operation looks good
- Each team needs to send their own packet identification methods
- I haven't tested with binary data since most teams are using ASCII
- Binary should work

## Simulating WVSU - actual format

- longer packets get cut, sending shorter packets (30 chars worked well in testing)

## long packets

- Changing modes from `raw` to `icanon`  fixes the packet mixing problem
