Notes that would impact the systems the collective will be working on. 

- RocksatX - start 2018 initially 
	- Danny Boudan: NASA mission manager
	- 2 other people not present 
-  We may get action items to address:
	- The meeting will be recorded and shared on the drive
- No down selects
	- Basically we are good to go on funding and being on the mission
- 
## CoDR - General notes
- Differences from typical rocksatX
	- No active pointing
	- No recovery
	- There is despin from 5-7 Hz to 0.5 Hz
	- Apogee modification: 250 km higher and longer flight than normal
	- August: Integration, But it could be July
	- November: is the integration trip

## Telemetry 

-  Use timed events to turn on and off different experiments to conserve on downlink data
- Need 10 UARTS: Current MCU only has 8

## General comments

- Gravity waves can be a mission alone (its a good thing)
- GSE2 line cannot be turned off
- PDR: 7 - 11 of October
- CDR: Dates are in the user guide
- ground testing: inhibits would be need. 
	- Address these at the PDR
- Telemetry request: Whats the highest we can get
	- Numbers for how long we got data: +30s
	- WFF: could request additional shielding to extend
