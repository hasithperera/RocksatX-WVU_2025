	- 1024 cuda
	- 32 tenson
	- 4 GB RAM
	- $500 with carrier
- J1020:
	- 128 cores
- J4010 [link](https://www.seeedstudio.com/reComputer-J4011-p-5585.html)

- I am working on getting hands on time with an older Jetson Nano and wanna see what it can do with a raspi camera and openCV
	- Depending on that we can think about the RAM and cuda core requirement
	- I have to figure out software for it that works too
	- Do we want to put one with or without the carrier board\
		- Advantage:
			- It's cheaper $250 for a modern 4 GB one which is a good start.
			- no unneeded ports
		- Disadvantages
			- we have to make a custom carrier board with camera modules, and may be boot SD. not sure. might not be trivial
