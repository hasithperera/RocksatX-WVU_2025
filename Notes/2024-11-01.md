Meeting with Michal, Hasith and Gabriela

- Training data - Comments from Michal
	- Size of the images. aka input image
	- Max size of the image and the number of layers
- What are we trying to do:
	1. Debarring images
	2. low light camera settings
	3. selecting images for downlink
- We get training images for them
	- Setting up the RP and get images
	- CNN would be nice and good to do
- Michael:Â 
	- Debluring is good. - Ok sounds good
- Q: Can we generate simulated data ?
	- Get pictures from Raspi and then apply a rotational trasformation based on rotation rate. (We know its from 1-10 Hz)
	- give known rotation number and image sets. ask the network to predict the rotation rate
- Q: Have you though about what are we using to evaluating these
	- A: difference of images (unblurred and blurred)
- Time line early January for blurring 

## RocksatX Zoom - Notes 

- 230 kbps
- for a 5 min flight thats ~ 8MB
- is there a parachute ? 
	- This would 
- No parallel ?
	- We can interface with the Raspi and buffer the data
	- By CDR estimate the data as well as we can
	- After CDR confirm the data allocations

 
## Alternate data products

- One image is hit/miss 
	- I would put us at 10-20% success rate for this
- We should send some internal telemetry
	- $\omega_{ml}$ - rotation rates detected by ML
	- $\omega_{IMU}$ - IMU based rotation
	- exposure values 
	- downward camera id based on every thing
