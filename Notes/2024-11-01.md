Meeting with Michal, Hasith and Gabriela

- Training data - Comments from Michal
	- Size of the images. aka input image
	- Max size of the image and the number of layers
- What are we trying to do:
	1. Debarring images
	2. low light camera settings
	3. selecting images for downlink
- We get training images for them
	- Setting up the RP and get images
	- CNN would be nice and good to do
- Michael:Â 
	- Debluring is good. - Ok sounds good
- Q: Can we generate simulated data ?
	- Get pictures from Raspi and then apply a rotational trasformation based on rotation rate. (We know its from 1-10 Hz)
	- give known rotation number and image sets. ask the network to predict the rotation rate
- Q: Have you though about what are we using to evaluating these
	- A: difference of images (unblurred and blurred)
- Time line early January for blurring
