## Testing the telemetry system + algorithm


- Using  payloads:
	1. Fast payload: 30 character packets, 150 Hz,115200 baud
	2. Slow payload: 30 char packet, 10 Hz, 9600 baud

--- 
## using a shared buffer - with omp

## fast payload 
- Data drops are there.

## slow payload

 - used 
## 2. 2 X HS payloads sending at the same time

data from `g.txt`
