## Notes for getting started 

Git is used as the main method of syncing/sharing documentation and progress. 

1. Make a git account
2. Install git on your computer. (on mac/linux can be done on the cmd, on windows needs an installer)
3. generate ssh-keys: `ssh-keygen` press enter all the way. this will make a rsa key typically inside `~/.ssh`
4. add the ssh key to your git account. `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` copy paste to your profile.
5. clone the repo using the ssh link: `git clone git@github.com:hasithperera/RocksatX-WVU.git`
   
- Recommend using and setting up [obsidian-md](https://obsidian.md/) (this is a free note taking tool and you only need to install it most of the configuration is done to work with git and other requirements)
- A good tutorial for basic markdown syntax can be found [here](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
